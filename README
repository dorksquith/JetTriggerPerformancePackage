*** 1. Compiling Code and Getting Ready ************************************

The JetTriggerPerformancePackage is a rootcore package and is therefore
compiled by using rootcore. It also uses an additional package, the xAODAna-
Helpers package, that is not part of the Rootcore AnalysisBase. This means
that a copy of xAODAnaHelpers is needed in the same directory in which you
copied JetTriggerPerformancePackage.

You can download xAODAnaHelpers by using:

  git clone https://github.com/UCATLAS/xAODAnaHelpers

More informations can be found here: https://xaodanahelpers.readthedocs.io/en/master/Installing.html

After you succesfully cloned xAODAnaHelpers it is time to compile the rootcore
packages. JTPP was designed using the Rootcore Analysis Base 2.4.9 which we
therefore recommend to use. For the compilation, use the following command lines:

  setupATLAS
  rcSetup Base,2.4.9
  rc find_packages
  rc compile

The compilation can take some minutes. If something goes wrong during the compilation and you would like to compile again, use 'rc clean' for cleaning first.

*** 2. Setting Configurations in JTPP  ************************************

JTPP offers various options for jet trigger performance studies which are
specified in a config file. An example for such a file is given by

 scripts/config_OpMagic_v1.0.py

You will find more informations about the available options in this file.
In order to test your settings, you can also use  config_OpMagic_v1.0.py
for a run straight ahead. Please note that it's important to keep the syntax
in the config file to guarantee a succesfull run.
